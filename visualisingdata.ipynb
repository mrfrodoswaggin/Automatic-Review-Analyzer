This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!\",\n",

Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.

I made it at 5 gallons by putting in all of the juice concentrate, but only re-constituting with water up to the 5 gallon mark.  I also added 30 Grams of Oak Chips.  Now, I personally don't like a lot of oak in a wine.

You should trust your tongue, and not worry about what others say.  You can always add more oak, you can't take it away...<br /><br />I put the oak in the carboy for the secondary fermentation.  Not in the bucket.  I learned that from copying a Mosti Mondale kit.  Some kits but oak dust in the primary...  So far, I have had good luck with the oak chips in the secondary.<br /><br />The wine does taste much better, if you let it sit in the bottle 6 months after you bottle it.  But, you will most likely not be able to wait that long....  Put 3 or 4 bottles away to age, if you can't wait for the whole batch...<br /><br />To learn about the process, I learned everything I know from looking at the videos on the finevinewines.com website.

You can also look to youtube for a few good demonstrations...<br /><br />You will need some equipment to do this, but you don't need more than a beginner equipment kit to be successful.

The first ingredient listed on the package is almonds and that flavor was very noticeable for me.  The peanuts also add a distinct taste.  (The picture on the wrapper shows cashews and walnuts, but they are not in the ingredient listing and I did not find them in the bar.)  The two types of nuts combined with the chia and sunflower seeds and agave fiber provide any \"crunch\" you might be expecting.  I could not specifically see or taste the blueberry and cranberry fruits, but they are definitely there.  The pomegranate seeds are very visible.  The flavors all meld very well.  There was just enough individual nut flavor and the fruit combination provided the sweetness.  I did notice that the second ingredient is brown rice syrup, but since the bar is not overly sweet I think most of the sweet flavor comes from the fruits.<br /><br />At 190 calories per bar this seems to be a snack you would want to keep track of to make sure you don\\'t eat too many simply because they are so good, especially since 100 of those calories come from the fats.  I did find that the bar was rather sticky.  In fact, it has been quite a chore getting the bar separated from the wrapper so that I can eat it.  Then I\\'m left holding a sticky bar.  To counteract that you can simply hold the bottom of the bar by the wrapper as you eat it.  That brings me to one aspect of the bars which I\\'m not completely happy about.  Since the bar is sticky I chose to cut it into bite size pieces.  Anyone with any dental concerns at all will want to be careful when biting into this very dense, sticky bar.  And, if you are like me and have teeth set very close together, the seeds from the blueberries and cranberries can be a real challenge.  I find myself needing to use dental floss after eating each bar.

It has a full, rich flavor, which is surprising considering that it is definitely less aromatic than similar vanilla products. In fact, one has to lean in close even to a just opened bag to get a whiff of the vanilla (which for those of us who enjoy the smell of coffee, and particularly flavored coffee, is a disappointment). However, once brewed, the vanilla flavoring comes across in just the right amount. On the second brewing, we (my husband and I) did decide to make it a bit stronger just for personal tastes, but this coffee is smooth and full even without the extra boost. Definitely a coffee we'd both recommend to lovers of flavored coffees!\",\n",

This led me to do some online research and I discovered that they decided to mess with their ingredients.  I don\\'t know how pork could possibly give this food a \"better flavor\" than before, but my cats HATE this food.  I have one cat that will eat pretty much anything, except this apparently.  Now I have a $40/12lb bag of food that neither cat will eat.<br /><br />As expensive as this diet is, I had expected better from Nature\\'s Variety and I am sad to say I canceled my auto-refill subscription and now have to find a new diet.  I can\\'t believe that a company that prides themselves on producing a diet similar to what cats would eat in the wild would add pork flavor to their food.  I can see a wild cat eating rabbit, but not a pig!  Also, it would have been nice to see this new formula advertised on their bag of food - I had to find out on my own that they had been messing around.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Amazon\\'s customer service is awesome.  I inquired about returning the food, and although they do not take returns on grocery items, they did refund the full amount.  I wasn\\'t expecting a refund, but was very pleased with their customer service, this is why I will continue to do most of my shopping on Amazon.com!<br /><br />I have now tried the Instinct Chicken flavor and, while both cats do enjoy this food, I am still wishing I had an alternative protein source (i.e. rabbit or venison) in case the sensitivity was actually an allergy to chicken (I\\'m hoping it\\'s just an allergy to grains, as this is pretty common).',\n",

Of the 6 dented cans 3 had opened, exposing the formula to air and spilling some out.  We've ordered this from another online retailer before and the packaging was great.  Four cans to a box and 2 boxes to a larger shipping box.

       " 'I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a \"moderate\" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of \"give,\" and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog\\'s digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a \"grain of rice\"--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a \"powerful\" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company\\'s liability, but they are right.',\n",

I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good...

Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12.  The high from this is extremely stable and hasn\\'t yet given me the jitters.  I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed.  I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym.  The let down is probably the smoothest you\\'ll find among energy drinks.  And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.<br /><br />The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water.  You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy!  If you don\\'t get the lid on fast enough, you\\'ll quickly find there will be a mess!  I\\'ve found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg).  It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn\\'t utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys.  With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don\\'t over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg \"proprietary\" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root.  I don\\'t know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I\\'m partial to Grape and Orange Soda.  The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.<br /><br />This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink.',\n",

This particular flavor became our household favorite due to the effect it has on our easliy excited black lab, Hayden.<br /><br />At first I thought the ingredients were just light flavoring, since all of the packages seem to contain the exact same looking treats.  But, the smell is very strong.  This flavor contains chamomile and lavender - which claims to calm your dog.  This claim is very true for our dog.  Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don\\'t believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can\\'t be predicted for really young dogs or \"unfixed\" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to \"battle through\" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2\">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.

I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products.

This new teal-bag number 4 coffee may be presented as being the same 'balanced roast' that Henry's blend was, with nothing more than a fab new presentation... but don't be fooled. It's not just the bag that's changed: This stuff tastes like little more than brown water. YUCK!<br /><br />Original review (no longer applicable) follows:<br /><br />I originally bought Henry's Blend a few years back because it had a cat on it. They've since removed the cat, which is a shame because suckers for cat-promotions on coffee would totally pass this up as just another coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rather picky about my coffees. Previous to Henry's Blend I'd only truly enjoy something from our local bean roasters. I loathe Starbucks (tastes burnt to me), the other common brands all end up tasting watery and bland, but Henry's blend is just right - somewhere in the middle. It isn't too strong, it isn't too mild, and it has that stink that my mom calls the 'cat pee smell' (ironically) but not in a really intense way. More like mellow cat pee smelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I've tried others in the past few years but not one has had the right balance, and so back to Henry's blend I go. Its only drawback is that, at the rate I drink it, it's an awfully pricey habit to take up.\",\n",

This review is a comparison between the Bob\\'s Red Mill and Tropical Traditions finely shredded coconut which I have been buying on their website - for some reason Amazon carries many of their products but not their coconut.<br /><br />Here is my comparison.<br /><br />Freshness- This item arrived with an expiration date of 3/2013, which is eleven months from delivery.  I wish I knew what the exp date was on the TT brand - but it lasted me well over a year on my shelf and I believe that since they harvest the Coconut (they are primarily a coconut products company) it may have been fresher.<br /><br />Price- I buy the Tropical Traditions in the plastic 3.5 gallon pail, which I buy online when it is half price at $17.50, which costs about $5 a lb.<br /><br />I decided to compare it to Bob\\'s Red Mill which I researched and felt was probably the highest quality on Amazon, so I got it with the Subscribe n Save, so I saved a little more.  Without the Subscribe n Save, Bob\\'s Mill has free shipping and currently comes to $4.38 a lb. I think Bob\\'s Mill is priced well for what you are getting.<br /><br />Shred size- is very close - but the Bob\\'s Red Mill is slightly larger.  I felt that the Tropical traditions was just a little too small for my taste.  It \"disappeared\" in my cooking and oatmeal and I never got to enjoy the crunch or the chew of it, only able to enjoy the flavor and smell.<br /><br />Dryness- both were equally dry and felt very similar.<br /><br />Aroma- the Tropical Traditions won hands down here.  The Bob\\'s Mills smelled fresh enough, just a very mild slightly toasted smell.  But the Tropical traditions has a much stronger sweet coconut smell (it is NOT a sweetened coconut product) which I find very appealing.  And this is after sitting on my shelf for over a year! It was not rancid at all. Since both of these items are shredded finely, and as I said, I do not \"feel\" the coconut in my food, I\\'ll probably go back to the Tropical Traditions line since that is what I am left to enjoy - the smell.<br /><br />Packaging-  I like that Bob\\'s Mill is conveniently packaged in 4 backs so you can freeze three for later.  The Tropical Traditions comes in a plastic pail that is very very hard to open.  And then you really don\\'t want to keep opening it.  Plus it does not fit in the freezer or fridge.  So the pail is a waste in my opinion.  I use mine for other things.<br /><br />I rate both products as 5 star items. Tropical Traditions wins if money and packaging are not an issue.  If they are then Bob\\'s Mill wins handily.<br /><br />We eat a lot of coconut, I use it in my cooking and we eat it for breakfast.  We eat it at least 3 to 4 times a week in our oatmeal mixed in with organic flax seed, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036Q6DSS\">Flax USA 100% Natural Organic Flax Cold Milled Ground Golden Flax Seed, 40-Ounce Packages</a> home frozen blue berries (store bought have high pesticides) and maple syrup.

In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it.

I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup.

But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I\\'d stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x\\'s a day, it would come right back.

But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn\\'t believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn\\'t sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.

As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.\",\n",

There is a taste that I always equate to vitamins in them but that\\'s the added protein. Try drinking a protein powder and you\\'ll see what I mean. It has a very high amount of protein for such a small serving, this alone makes it worth drinking no matter your size.

Although I prefer a light/medium roast, this might be a little too light and mild, even for my tastes.  If you prefer a very light roast, then this would be perfect for you.  It is otherwise smooth and seems like low acidity (my stomach isn't upset by it or anything) which are both great pluses.  Since I prefer my coffee a little darker than this, I will probably just add an extra scoop of coffee to the pot to get it up to my taste preference.<br /><br />I wish Coffee Bean Direct made a darker roasted fair trade coffee, b/c the price sure is right!  Just as an FYI - BJ's Sumatran Fair Trade is very tasty medium/dark roast, and it's actually a little cheaper than Coffee Bean Direct's fair trade.<br /><br />enjoy!\",\n",

       " 'I don\\'t know why this is not known to everyone, everywhere, but cats should eat a grain free, wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains, so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food, yet to save money, they put it in. Also, cats naturally have a very low thirst drive, and with the correct diet, they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet, they will have to drink to get their water, and with the low thirst drive that is natural, a lot of cats don\\'t get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important, and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food, and over a couple weeks, switch them to a grain free, wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy, but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty, and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes, it is canned in Thailand, but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US, but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus, at least with the chicken flavors, is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell, but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it, and it was good! Of course, it is also important to give them a variety, so I give him some of the \"fishy\" ones too, but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food, but whether you feed this one or another one, please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!',\n",

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity.

But when I went to the store to buy more of the steak rub, I couldn't find it. Anywhere. I searched in different supermarkets, gourmet shops, kitchen stores, all to no avail.<br /><br />Finally it occurred to me that I should look for the product online.

This has the potential to be a very strong tea, which I prefer.  The chocolate is most prevalent if you take the teabag early and opt for a weak tea.  Even then, it is just of hint of chocolate not a strong chocolate flavor.  As the tea sits longer, the mint and tea flavors tend to overwhelm the chocolate so there is just the barest hint left.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn\\'t seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they\\'ve grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn\\'t have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \"treat\" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I\\'m not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don\\'t want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I\\'m concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet.

For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by \"that other chain\" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn\\'t seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu\\'s....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don\\'t put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef\\'s Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don\\'t correct for this, and thus I\\'m a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.

Now, in my fifties, I tend to use them as my family has for generations: as an accompaniment for different dishes, as well as a mixer in certain other recipes.<br /><br />I didn't discover Frank's until around 25 years ago, as it doesn't come from the South.  However, I fell in love with it on first taste, and it has been in my kitchens ever since.  The unique ingredient that Frank's has is its infusion of garlic.  Not strong, but there.  The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.

I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)\",\n",

The oil does not taste like a high quality olive oil. Moreover, the first package had a large number of pits fragments that were small enough not to be seen but large enough to damage teeth and dental work. Overall, 2 stars for my first bagged serving.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my experience with these olives took a turn for the worse. Upon opening the second bag, I noticed that there was white residue and spots all over the olives - a picture is posted. I'm guessing it's mold. It could be due to a package that was never fully or properly sealed, or it could be due to the manner in which Amazon stored them, or perhaps a combination of the two. Regardless, it's simply unacceptable to open a food product and find it in this condition. I would give it 0 stars now if I could.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I don't recommend this product. I previously tried the green olives from this brand, which were great, but I won't be repurchasing anything from the the Cat Cora by Gaea brand again because of this experience - that includes previous purchases of olive oils, green olives and tapenades.

Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.\",\n",

Product pricing seems to be related to the number of \"doses\", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.

She is not a big chewer, and doesn't like bones, so I wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth. I was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the US. When you get them out of the package they don't look like food, but the dogs don't really mind. They are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog.\",\n",

Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Black Cherry flavor in particular tastes great, although the Starberry Kiwi and Watermelon flavors aren't bad either.  Refreshing, worthwhile, and much healthier than any diet soda or nearly any other carbonated beverage, The Switch is definitely worth trying out if you're looking for something refreshing, healthy, and tasty.\",\n",

By offering a blend, Senseo can change the mix to reflect their current costs for the various Columbian beans. The next time I purchase this, if I do, it could have an entirely differant taste.',\n",

But Melitta has not been a great company that produces the best coffee filters, but they've also got some really strong coffee flavors to call their own. That comes with their cafe collection, and their Hazelnut Creme Brulee. The taste is absolutely very smooth and mild to the taste buds, yet remain sophisticated and strong from the first time you simply whiff the smell and aroma. I absolutely loved the taste of it from the very first sip. I absolutely recommend this as another delightful flavor in your morning cup of joy in the morning.

Our dog began having seizures after we started a training class with her where they recommended using pup peroni. We used the pup peroni as a training treat as recommend. Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again. In researching this, we found there is a link between pup peroni (propylene glycol) and seizures. Poisoning....Buyer beware.',\n",

The other problem is that these are crunchy but instead almost have a gummy consistency which just doesn't work in solid bar form.\",\n",

That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism.
